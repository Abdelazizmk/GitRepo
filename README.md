Some attributes for the json obtained by fakestoreapi are missing and thus cannot be used to make the design dynamic. Hence some areas of the code are Static.
There is also no indication and/or no design available on making the page responsive on different screen sizes and hence this page should be viewed at max screen width.

Different pages:
Home = "/"
Shop full width = "/Shop"
Shop full filter = "/Shop2"
Detail = "/product"
Cart = "/Cart"
The routing for this pages are done manually (by manually putting the correct string to move pages) because there is no indication and/or design available on which button moves to which page.
